# Codebook

## The dataset is included in the UCI HAR Dataset folder following the folder structure defined in the ZIP provided. It contains the following files:

* 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

* 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

* 'features.txt': List of all features.

* 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

* 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

* 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

* 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

* 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

##The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

* 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

* 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

* 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

* 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

##The root folder contains the following files:

* 'run_analysis.R': The script used to tidy and fuse the information contained in the dataset. 

* 'Readme.md': Readme file used to describe the analysis process. 

* 'Codebook.md': This file which modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information 

* 'tidydata.txt': This file contains the tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

* 'UCI HAR Dataset folder': This file contains the dataset, this structure should be followed in order for the script to work.
